RESUME CLASSIFICATION

AI Resume Screening is a tool that uses artificial intelligence to automate the process of resume screening and shortlisting. The tool uses natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to analyze resumes and classify them to the job roles based on the words in their resume.

Our tool will be designed to make the hiring process easier for both HR teams and job seekers. Our idea is to develop a user-friendly web page that enables HR teams to select the specific job role they are recruiting for. Once the job role is chosen, a link is shared with potential candidates who can then upload their resumes.

Using pre-trained machine learning models, which are trained on thousands of resumes , our tool automatically filters out resumes that do not match the job requirements. Resumes are categorized based on specific keywords and phrases related to the job role ( for example , python developer – main words can be python , developed , project , computer science etc). If a candidate's resume matches the job description, they are immediately notified and their resume is uploaded to the company's database. Even if a candidate’s resume doesn’t match the description , it shows the potential role which is suitable for the uploaded resume.

Our tool saves HR teams valuable time and energy as they no longer need to manually sift through hundreds of resumes. Job seekers also benefit from receiving immediate feedback on their eligibility, streamlining their job search process.
